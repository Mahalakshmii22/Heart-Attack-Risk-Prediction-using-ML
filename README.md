# Heart Attack Predictor

A simple machine learning project to predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on patient clinical data. This project helps demonstrate the use of data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation for healthcare analytics.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Predicts heart attack risk using clinical data (e.g., age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.)
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization
- Multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Model evaluation and selection
- Easy-to-understand predictions for new data

---

## 📊 Dataset

- The dataset used is the [Heart Disease UCI dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci) from Kaggle.
- You can download it and place it in the project directory as `heart.csv`.

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- (optional) jupyter

Install with:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## 💻 Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-attack-predictor.git
    cd heart-attack-predictor
    ```
2. **Download the dataset:**  
   Place `heart.csv` in the project folder.

3. **Run the code:**
    - Open and run `heart_attack_predictor.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
    - Or run the Python script:
      ```bash
      python heart_attack_predictor.py
      ```

## 📝 Project Steps

1. **Data Loading:**  
   Load clinical data from CSV.

2. **Preprocessing:**  
   Handle missing values, encode categorical data, scale features.

3. **EDA:**  
   Visualize distributions, correlations, and important features.

4. **Modeling:**  
   Train and compare different classification models.

5. **Evaluation:**  
   Check accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.

6. **Prediction:**  
   Predict heart attack risk for new patients.
